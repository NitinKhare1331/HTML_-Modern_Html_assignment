3 ways which helps us to improve the accessibility of HTML are:-
   Use ARIA, which stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. ARIA defines markup extensions that can be added to elements to give screen readers more information.

   Use Semantic Tags

   Use descriptive link text. Links can help or harm accessibility depending on how they are used.
